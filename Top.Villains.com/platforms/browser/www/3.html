			<p style="font-size:70px">AIZEN</p><p><i>(from Bleach)</i></p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Prior to his departure from Soul Society, Aizen appeared as a mild-featured 
			man with brown scholarly hair enhanced by square glasses, along with soft brown eyes. He wore the standard 
			Shinigami uniform with a captain's haori.[3] During his ascent to Hueco Mundo, he removed his glasses and 
			swept his hand through his hair, revealing menacing eyes and a very different hairstyle; his hair is now 
			swept back, with a strand hanging down his face.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">At an unknown point in the past, Aizen became part of the 5th Division under 
			Captain Shinji Hirako. He invested himself in the research and creation of the Hōgyoku even before Kisuke 
			Urahara. To this end, he sacrificed hundreds of Shinigami and hundreds of Rukongai citizens who bore Shinigami 
			talents to his own Hōgyoku, but it was not satisfied with this. At one point, a young Gin Ichimaru watched Aizen 
			meet with three other Shinigami who were kneeling before him. One of the Shinigami handed Aizen the Hōgyoku, prompting 
			Aizen to put the orb in a glass and hand it back to the Shinigami. Aizen and his subordinates left an unconscious Rangiku 
			Matsumoto a short distance away. Aizen eventually caught Shinji's attention, and was promoted to a lieutenant in order for 
			Shinji to watch over him closely, but Shinji's action only helped further the realization of his plans.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">He's a genius person. He's good at manipulating people around him that's why no one knew what his plans for the soul societies are.
			He is also a master swordsman, kido master, and a shunpo master.</p>
