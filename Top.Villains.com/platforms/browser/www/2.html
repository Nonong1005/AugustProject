			<p style="font-size: 70px">Madara Uchiha</p><p><i>(from Naruto Shippuden)</i></p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Madara was a fair-skinned man with spiky, black hair that had a slight blue tint to it. 
			Around his waist he had a white sash that held a sack, presumably containing his ninja tools. Later, his sash was replaced by a belt, 
			adorned with pouches and various weapons. He also wore another sash strapped across his shoulders which he used to hold his swords.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Madara was born during the Warring States Period, and was 
			the eldest of Tajima Uchiha's five sons. Madara and his brothers grew up on the 
			battlefield waging constant war with the Uchiha's rivals: the Senju. Three of his brothers 
			died young, leaving Madara with only his younger brother, Izuna. Madara and Izuna became 
			very close through their shared loss and constantly competed with each other to get stronger. 
			This, combined with his naturally strong chakra, enabled the young Madara to defeat adult Senju 
			in battle and develop a reputation as a genius.</p>

			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">
			Madara was one of the most gifted shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest member of the Uchiha clan in his lifetime.
			A child prodigy, he killed several adult Senju before he had awakened his Sharingan. History remembers him best for competing
			with Hashirama Senju, a "God of Shinobi", and pushing him to his absolute limits. When Obito began operating under Madara's name, 
			fear of Madara's power forced the Five Great Shinobi Countries, and the neutral Land of Iron, to band together and trigger the Fourth Shinobi World War.
