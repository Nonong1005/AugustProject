			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Despite being hundreds of years old, Zeref has the appearance 
			of a young man. He wears high-collared red and tan robes with gold trim, 
			along with a large, flowing white toga draped around his torso. He has short black hair, dark eyes, 
			and abnormally sharp canines.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Orphaned after Dragons killed his parents and his little brother, Natsu, an extremely 
			young Zeref became a student at the Mildian Magic Academy, where he researched the connections between life, death 
			and Magic to revive his brother. After creating things such as the R-System and the Eclipse Gate, he was expelled 
			from the academy for breaching the sacred teachings of Ankhseram, however he was cursed by Ankhseram and then killed 
			everyone around him with his newfound, unwanted Curse of Contradiction. After this, Zeref wished to die and wandered 
			around, creating the Etherious in the hopes that they would kill him, but instead turned to reviving his dead brother, 
			having preserved his body, as an Etherious, thus fulfilling his goal of bringing his brother back and creating something 
			that could kill him: E.N.D.; Etherious Natsu Dragneel.</p>
