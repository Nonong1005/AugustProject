			<hr/>
			<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Meruem appears to be rather humanoid for an Ant. He was muscular and toned, despite 
			relatively small frame as compared to his servants. He had two long antennae on his ears, and large shell-like armor over his
			 head that resembles a helmet. There were dark pigmented areas on his arms, legs, chest, and head. Meruem was always barefoot. He also possessed
			  a powerful tail equipped with a singer that serves as his weapon. Both hus hands and feet had only four fingers.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Mereum was the next to the last ant born of the Queen and held the title of Chimera Ant King. 
			He was born prematurely, forcibly birthed rupturing through the Queens abdomen. According to the sociology of Chimera Ants, upon the birth of the King, 
			the Royal GUards will solely follow his commands and he will leave the nest to find various mate with and impregnate in order to create the next Chimera Ant Queen. 
			Soon after he was born, Meruem left his original nest in NGL with his Royal Guardsin search of a place to start his kingdom at. His name means "The Light that shines on everything".</p>

			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Despite being a new born, Meruem is he most powerful Chimera Ant. His immense strength, unfathomable speed, agility, reflexes, duarability
			and pain tolerance is what made him the strongest character in the anime so far. But what really is number one weapon is his intellegence. His overwhelming talent 
			allows him to analyze and learn anything instantly, and home his strategies to perfection.</p>
