			<p style="font-size: 70px">NARAKU</p><p><i>(from Inuyasha)</i></p>
			<hr/>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">He has a pale skin and dark colored curly hair. He is always seen wearing blue suit and had a bone-like accessory that has spikes and giant eye in the middle.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Naraku is responsible for most of the characters' misfortunes, including the death of Kikyo, the sealing of Inuyasha to 
			the sacred tree, Miroku's curse, and the death of Sango's family. Naraku was born from the fusion of Onigumo, a crippled human bandit tended by Kikyo, 
			and a horde of weak demons. Driven by frustrated lust for Kikyo, Onigumo made a bargain with the demons: they could eat his flesh, and the demons would 
			combine into one entity to become part of that new body. However the resulting half-demon promptly caused Kikyo's death in an attempt to corrupt and possess 
			the Shikon Jewel-his intent being that she would use the jewel to save herself and thus both would be corrupted and be his. Unlike other Half-Demons, he can 
			choose what time will he lose his powers, however he reverts to a head attached to multiple demons. During this time he discards the weaker demons that he's 
			attached to.</p>
