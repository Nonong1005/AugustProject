			<p style="font-size: 70px">ACCELERATOR</p><p><i>(from Toaru Majutsu no Index)</i></p>
			<hr/>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Accelerator appears as a skinny teen and has pale skin, moppy 
			white hair and red eyes. This is caused by his ability, as it blocks 
			ultraviolet rays, thereby preventing his body from producing 
			melanin. His ability also reduces the outside influence so much tha
			it causes a loss of balance in his hormones, giving him what he 
			calls an "androgynous appearance," although there is definite 
			evidence stated throughout the series that he is a boy.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p style="font-size: 50px">Much of Accelerator's past is unknown, but he mentioned that he 
			once had a "normal name" which has yet to be revealed, and most likely 
			never will, as Accelerator himself forgot it. The novels state that his 
			last name consists of two kanji and his first name three, yet his name 
			had no real meaning in it.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Ever since taking the Power Curriculum Program, and realizing his powers, 
			Accelerator was sent to a "special class", most likely, the Special Ability 
			Institute, and spent much of his childhood there until nine years old, before 
			being moved into another special class. Both of these had him as the only student. 
			It can be presumed that this occurred before the incident involving the military.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h4><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">He has the ability to control vectors and influence objects 
			that have vectors such as bullets, heat, and electricity. Also with his incredible mind, 
			he was able to use his ability in different ways.</p>
