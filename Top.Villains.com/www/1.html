			<p style="font-size: 70px"></p>BEERUS<p><i>(from Dragonball Super)</i></p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Beerus is a purple, anthromorphic sphynx with large pointed ears, 
			similar to Cornish Rex and sphynx cats. His form is hairless and while overall defined in built, 
			he is very thin and bony. He is of a similar height to Goku, being slightly shorter, but his ears 
			making him appear taller. He dons black, blue, and gold Egyptian-looking attire with the same white 
			and orange diamond decorations as his mentor Whis. Beerus is modeled after Akira Toriyama's hairless cat, Debo.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Not much is known from Beerus since he was only a new character but out of the many gods in the universe, 
			Beerus is the most feared. He is feared by the Kais, the Supreme Kais, King Cold, Frieza, King Vegeta, Vegeta, and even Shenron 
			himself. As a God of Destruction, he is tasked with maintaining balance in the universe.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">
			He is the God of Destruction. That statement alone says it all. Earning that title means he is something else. He demonstrated it by toying around a Super Saijan 3 Goku in Kayusama's Planet.
