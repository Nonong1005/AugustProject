			<hr/>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Blackbeard is an extremely tall man with a massive build, as his body is 
			round with relatively thin limbs. He has a big mouth with several broken or missing teeth 
			, a pronounced crooked nose and a very large and hairy chest and torso. Long, thick, woolly black hair 
			falls down the back of his neck, underneath a black bandana, and a small scruffy black beard grows around 
			his jawline. As the series progresses, his beard becomes longer and scruffier. He is extremely tall, being 
			exactly twice Luffy's pre-timeskip height.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Blackbeard aspires to become the Pirate King. In order to do this, he wanted the Yami 
			Yami no Mi. At no older than 16, he joined the Whitebeard Pirates to search for it, thinking that he would have 
			the best chance of obtaining the fruit that way. He would then serve under Whitebeard for at least 20 years before 
			his betrayal. 22 years ago, after Shiki escaped Impel Down, Blackbeard at age 18 was present amongst Marco, Jozu, 
			Vista, Blenheim, and Haruta while the Flying Pirate spoke to Whitebeard about his plan.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h4><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Teach is an immensely powerful pirate even before that he was still a White Beard pirate. Being able
			to scratch the Emperor Red Hair Shanks on the left eye. And now that he obtained two Devil fruits makes him more dangerous.</p>
