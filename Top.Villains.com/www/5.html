			<hr/>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Father's second form looks identical in appearance to Hohenheim, 
			excluding hair and skin color, hairstyle, clothing, a few additional wrinkles, and a lack of 
			glasses. Hohenheim has referred to this form as nothing more than a human-like husk that Father uses to hide his true appearance.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p style="font-size:50px">While it is never fully explored, the being that would later call itself Father was originally a part 
			of the existence within the Gate. Using the blood of his slave Number 23, the Alchemist to the King of Xerxes managed to contain 
			a small portion of the knowledge and life of the Gate within a flask, capable of existing in the physical realm. Named simply 
			"Dwarf in the Flask" or "Homunculus" by the people of Xerxes, this sentient creature contained a vast amount of knowledge, the most 
			important and influential being the skills that would become standard alchemy.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">He has vast knowledge and Philosopher stone enchanced alchemy. He even swallowed "God" in the series that gave him every ability you can think of.
