			<hr/>
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p style="font-size:50px">Shishio has red eyes. Before his attempted execution, had black eyebrows, black slick back hair
			 ending in a hair ponytail, and a fair complexion. After being burned, Shishio's skin is brown and cracked, sometimes appearing red. 
			 He wears bandages around his entire body in order to ease the pain and hide his deformity. The remains of his hair stick out of 
			 his head bandages in tufts. Over his bandageshe wears a robe, which varies from indigo to purple depending on the lighting.
			 Both before and after his immolation, Shishio tended to wear his kimono with his right side of his chest and right arm exposed.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p style="font-size:50px">After the death of Yukishiro Tomoe, Himura Kenshin became a free wielding swordsman to protect members 
			of the Ishin Shishi. Shishio Makoto, born August 1848 in Kyoto Prefecture, became his successor as hitokiri (literally 
			"manslayer", assassin) and was responsible for the assassination of I'izuka, the man who had betrayed the Choshu party. The 
			future Meiji government was more secretive about Shishio than Kenshin; many members of the Chōshū and Satsuma clans (the members 
			of the future Meiji government) had very little information on him.</p>

			<h2><i>Why he's on the list?</i></h2>
			<p style="font-size: 50px">Shishio's monstrous strength, stamina, resistance to injury, and ability to read his opponents place him in this list Top 9.</p>
